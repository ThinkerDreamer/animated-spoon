            <h2>Слава Україні!</h2>
            <p>Right now Ukraine is fighting a devastating war against the terrorist invading state of Russia. As a student of the Russian language, this is really horrifying to me. This isn't the way I wanted to study the language. However, I am also learning some Ukrainian at the same time because of this.</p>
            <div class="called-out">
                Now is the time to support our Ukrainian friends and neighbors. We must defend freedom and democracy in the world! We must not let evil win!

            <h2>My other interests</h2>
            <p>I'm currently a student of computer science, working on a bachelor's degree so that I'll be able to get a master's degree later in something else related to STEM, possibly AI and Robotics.</p>
            <p>My end goal is to become an astronaut with ESA or NASA. This has been my dream since I was a child, and yet I never dared to dream it until now. Somewhere along the line, I was told that it wasn't a realistic dream.</p>
            <p>Last year, at 32 years old, I realized that it <em>was</em> in fact <strong>possible</strong>. And now I'm focusing on making this incredible dream become a reality. My first step? Support myself as a programmer or web developer while continuing my university studies.</p>
